# Welcome to my implementation of git

I've been using Git for quite some time, and I thought it would be fun to gain a deeper understanding of how it works by attempting to rebuild it based on my interpretation of its functionality.

## Introduction

This project is a personal implementation of Git, the popular version control system. Itâ€™s written in Scala and aims to provide similar functionality to Git while exploring the underlying principles of how version control systems work.

### Commands implemented:
* `init <directory>` - Creates a new git repository. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init)
* `add <files>` - Adds a file to the staging area. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add)
* `commit <message>` - Record changes to the repository. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)
* `status` - Show the working tree status of the repository. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status)
* `log` - Show all commits made. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)
* `restore <files>` - Restore working tree files. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore)
* `restore--staged <files>` - Restore content in the index. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore)
* `checkout <hash>` - Restore working tree files to the given hash. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)
* `rm <files>` - Remove files from the worktree and index. [(git man page)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rm)
* `pls-work` - A desperate plea to the version control gods. Sometimes, you just need a little extra luck.

## Project layout

### Packages

The `main.scala` file has code to parse the command line arguments and call the respective "bridge functions" located in separate scala files. There are three types of packages:

    package gitcommands # has code for individual git commands
    package datastructs # has code for the data structures I've made
    package fileops # has helper functions related to file operations

A wegit repo looks like this:

    .wegit/
        INDEX
        COMMIT
        objs/
            e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  # a blob
            ...       # more blobs


All file objects are represented by a SHA hash. The contents of the file are compressed and stored in the `objs/` directory, where the name of the file is its SHA hash.

### Data Structures

An INDEX data structure and a COMMIT data structure are used to represent the current state of the repository.

The index looks like a `String => (String, String)` map. The key is the path of the file, and the tuple represents the `old` and `new` SHA hashes of the file. The `old` hash is the state of the file from the latest commit (or `null` if it didn't exist) and the `new` hash is the state of the file from the latest `git add` operation.

For example, an index file would look like this:
```plaintext

```
A commit is just a snapshot of an index file with an additional commit message, and a unique commit hash that is generated. It would look like this:
