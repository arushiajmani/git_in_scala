## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the _WE_GIT_ project!

### Project Overview:

The _WE_GIT_ project is being developed using **two programming languages**: **Scala** and **Go**. The team chose these languages to deepen our understanding of both functional and concurrent programming paradigms. Scala’s functional capabilities combined with the JVM ecosystem are well-suited for complex data analysis, while Go’s simplicity and excellent support for concurrent programming make it perfect for building high-performance and scalable applications.

### A Dual-Language Learning Experience:

_WE_GIT_ is not only a technical project but also a **learning journey** for the entire team. This project allows us to:

- **Enhance our understanding of Scala**
- **Strengthen our Go skills**

Both languages offer their own challenges and learning experiences. In the process, we are also improving our ability to work collaboratively, enabling us to integrate diverse solutions into a unified system.

### Project Goals:

Along the way, the project will serve as a platform for us to:

- **Learn** new programming concepts and improve our problem-solving skills.
- **Understand the challenges** of building scalable and modular systems.
- **Collaborate** effectively within a team.
- **Build real-world skills** that will help us in future projects and professional endeavors.

_WE_GIT_ is a perfect balance between a real-world solution and a comprehensive learning experience. By working on this project, the team aims to develop both technical expertise and a deeper understanding of software architecture, data processing, and system integration.
