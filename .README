I've been using Git for quite some time, and I thought it would be fun to gain a deeper understanding of how it works by attempting to rebuild it based on my interpretation of its functionality.

This project is a personal implementation of Git, the popular version control system. Itâ€™s written in Scala and aims to provide similar functionality to Git while exploring the underlying principles of how version control systems work.
